You may freely use this template for writing any sort of KDE documentation.

In the future, we may want to change from SGML-based DocBook to XML-based

- in XML, the case of the <tags> and attributes is relevant ;
- also, quote all attributes.

<!-- The contents of the documentation begin here.  Label
each chapter so with the id attribute. This is necessary for two reasons: it
allows you to easily reference the chapter from other chapters of your
document, and if there is no ID, the name of the generated HTML files will vary
from time to time making it hard to manage for maintainers and for the CVS
system. Any chapter labelled (OPTIONAL) may be left out at the author's
discretion. Other chapters should not be left out in order to maintain a
consistent documentation style across all KDE apps. -->

<title>Introduction</title>

application that explains what it does and where to report
problems. Basically a long version of the abstract.  Don't include a

<title>How to obtain KSSH</title>

<para>
&kssh; is part of the KDE project
<ulink url="http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</ulink>.
&kssh; can be found in the kdeutils package on
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/</ulink>, the
main ftp site of the KDE project. </para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="requirements">
<title>Requirements</title>

<!--
List any special requirements for your application here. This should include:
.Libraries or other software that is not included in kdesupport,
kdelibs, or kdebase.
.Hardware requirements like amount of RAM, disk space, graphics card
capabilities, screen resolution, special expansion cards, etc.
.Operating systems the app will run on. If your app is designed only for a
specific OS, (you wrote a graphical LILO configurator for example) put this
information here.
-->

<para>
In order to successfully use &kssh;, you need KDE 1.1. Foobar.lib is required
in order to support the advanced &kssh; features. &kssh; uses about 5 megs of
memory to run, but this may vary depending on your platform and
configuration.
</para>

<para>
All required libraries as well as &kssh; itself can be found
on <ulink url="ftp://ftp.kapp.org">The &kssh; home page</ulink>.

<!-- For a list of updates, you may refer to the application web site
or the ChangeLog file, or ... -->

<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>make install</userinput>

<para>Since KApp uses autoconf and automake you should have not trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the KDE mailing lists.</para>
